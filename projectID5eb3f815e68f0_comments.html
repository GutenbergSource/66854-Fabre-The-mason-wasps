<HTML><BODY>This is the eleventh book by Jean-Henri Fabre I release for proofreading in this "Fabre Flood" of books on insects. Most of these books are translations from his <i>Souvenirs Entomologiques</i>, however, not in the original order of chapters, but grouped by subject, and also includes some overlap of parts already published elsewhere in the series (or in other translations).

<p>The complete set makes an impressively detailed popular treatise of the lives of insects.

</p><p>The text itself is fairly straightforward to proof, so have fun!

</p><p>The original scans are in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/masonwaspstransl00fabruoft/page/i/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>.
